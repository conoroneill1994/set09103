The web app I have built is an app for the scottish premier league that tells
information about the 12 clubs in the league . It also shows the league table
at the moment. The home page has a blue header with the words Scottish premier
League on it which is in white so it stands out well on the background. The nav
bar has a background of haf between orange and yellow and has two links one
that takes the user to the league table and the other just keeps you on the
page you are on. Then the main section of the page has the 12 teams and
information about them and that is the a white background with black text. The
next page Is the same as the first apart from on the table page its the league
table on the main section and not information on the teams.

Features I would like to add are having the league table change automatically
done to results that happen in real life. Another would be to have image of the
badge on the same page instead of clicking a link to show them. Maybe more
pages as well and more information on the teams with an automatic change on
them also.

My own view on my app is its clear to read and its easy to get about I would
maybe say add more information on just to fill up some space.

I feel I have came a long way in learning how to use python as I only started
using it few months ago . Challenges I have faced is getting an image on the
same page as the html and not having to create a link to just route with the
image on it. I also didn't understand how to link back to a page by clicking
on the home page on the second page but I figured it out by looking online and
I got javascript:history.go(-1) and I found this on stackoverflow help.
