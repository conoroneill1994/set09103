A

The app I created is an app that lets the public find jobs and apply for them
with a few simple clicks of a button. It has 4 pages Home , review , apply and
a thank you page.

B

All the pages have the same desgin and URL structure with only the main section
changing , which is a great use of consistency.
Home page main section has a drop down for the user to select and that is when
the user is aloud to click what job they want to apply for and once done they
can press the apply button . Which then takes the user to the apply page that
has a form to fill out , the user has to fill out there name , email and then
upload there cv and once thats done click apply again which takes them to a
thank you page. The review page lets the user mark the site out of 5 by
clicking on the stars.

C

Features I would have liked to include are ;
1. Having new jobs uploaded everyday.
2. A login so every user has different accounts so they can just upload there
cv once and can use it everytime they apply for jobs and also can upload images
of themselves and a description of them.

I have should given myself more time to do this project so I could add more
features to the app

As I said in section D I let myself down with time as I missed the deadline and
never got as much done as I wish I did. The biggest challenge I faced was
inserting javascript into this project I tried everything but I couldn't get it
to work. I do feel I have learned a lot of good things since the first
coursework such as being able to navigate pages by clicking on the link , also
putting images onto a page with that has other things on the page and also
learned how to use the upload method , testing and redirects.

Got most of my code from the workbook on module
